  phrases:
  - Good day, my lord! While I am glad to see your majesty again, it saddens me that
    you couldn't reach the throne yet.
  - 'I''m sure you will get there some day. At least until then I sometimes get someone
    to talk to... Without getting any replies. But your presence alone makes my day
    better. '
  - 'I assume the caves really are as dangerous as they say... '
  - '*The gravekeeper stares into the distance, sadness lingers on his face for a
    split second until he remembers you''re there* '
  - 'Right, as I was saying, those caves must be full of evil monsters if they could
    overpower you. I guess you get reanimated in my graveyard every time you die.
    Which is an honor, of course! But  it is also a pity. '
  - 'I''ll stop wasting your time with my rambling, best of luck to you, my lord!
    If you ever want someone to talk to... or to hear someone talking, I''m always
    here. '
