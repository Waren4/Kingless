  phrases:
  - I'm sure you've met the green imp in the graveyard by now. He's a weird one.
  - 'We have scary stories to tell to kids about imps so they listen to us, but actually
    meeting an imp like that one kind of contradicts all of them. '
  - 'When he first appeared, I tried to chase him one, but he''s very quick, so I
    eventually gave up and tried talking to him. '
  - 'His stories are sort of interesting, even though I don''t understand most of
    what he says. It makes my life less dull listening to his fantastical tales like
    going to "Demon School". '
  - 'Though his voice gets annoying eventually so I usually don''t spend that much
    time talking to him and just tell him to catch some rats, which also happen to
    be his favorite food. '
