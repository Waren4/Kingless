  - You know...
  - My son just wanted to follow in your footsteps.
  - He heard all the stories about how bravely you defended our people numerous times.
    He wanted to be like you.
  - He was a silly little kid, only eight years old. I made him a wooden sword for
    his birthday this year, so he could "play king"...
  - ' A few days later he disappeared, I think he went into the cave, trying to be
    as brave as you were, fighting the evil of the world.'
  - If not for those stories...
  - My son would still be alive.
  - More or less, you killed my son.
  - '...'
  - I'm sorry, sire.
  - I did not mean to be so rude. My emotions got the best of me for a moment. Please
    accept my apologies.
