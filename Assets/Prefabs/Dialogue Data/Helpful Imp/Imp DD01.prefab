  - Hello sire
  - You seem to have gotten yourself in quite the pickle.
  - ' Wait, wait! Put the sword down, I can help you. I''ve defected the evil forces
    and now live in this graveyard.'
  - 'I don''t know the details, but the world now revolves around you. People might
    find different things to say to you if you get stronger, for example. '
  - 'Before I escaped from the other imps, I read an inscription on a magical tablet.
    It read: "The king can press ESC to acces the Level Up Menu from which he can
    become stronger if he has accumulated enough experience" '
  - 'I''m just as confused as you are, but you are a clever king. I''m sure you''ll
    figure it out. It also said you can "press E" to stop talking to people. Whatever
    that means. '
