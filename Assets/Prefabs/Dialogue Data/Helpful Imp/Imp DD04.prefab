  - 'Having a hard time in those caves? I remembered something I saw scribbled on
    a wall in Impleton. A prophecy-like thingy. Probably just a homeless imp who smoked
    too many rat tails but maybe it means something to you. '
  - 'It read "The king can change the Difficulty in the Options Menu if he thinks
    his task is too hard or too easy." '
  - Entirely bonkers, I can't make any sense of it.
  - Anyway, see you next time.
