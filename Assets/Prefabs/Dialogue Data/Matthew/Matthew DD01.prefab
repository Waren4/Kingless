  phrases:
  - 'Oh my! You scared me, my lord. I''m not used to seeing skeletons around town.  '
  - 'What happened to you?  '
  - . . .
  - Right, I guess you can't speak now, apologies.
  - 'I''m Matthew, the mayor''s son. I don''t know what could possibly have turned
    you into a skeleton, but I''ve seen someone who might. '
  - 'For the past few days, a strange masked man has been standing near the pond in
    our village. He seems really unusual and not the kind of folk you expect to see
    around these parts. '
  - 'No one has talked to him yet, we are all minding our own business around here.
    I would be careful around him though, sometimes there are purple things shining
    in his pockets. Very weird. '
  - 'Anyway, I might be able to help you a little. Sometimes I sell things that I
    find while working the fields. You wouldn''t believe what kinds of things people
    leave burried in the crops. '
  - 'I have nothing on me now, but another day I might have something to sell to you,
    my lord. Of course, you would receive a Royalty discount.  '
  - I wish you good luck, your majesty! You need to get back to the throne. Life is
    already hard enough, living without a ruler to fight for our people would be even
    harder.
