  phrases:
  - '*The Strange Man stuffs the purple flame he was holding inside his pocket*'
  - 'Hello there, sire. Long time no see. '
  - You look quite puzzled. Don't remember me?
  - '*His voice seems familiar, yet forced, like he is trying to use a deeper tone.
    His appearance baffles you, you don''t recall ever meeting this man. The mask
    makes it hard to distinguish any facial features except his bright green eyes.* '
  - 'Well, I guess my identity is none of your concern for now, you probably just
    want to know how to get back to that lovely throne of yours... Hahahaha. '
  - 'But if you put your reckless desire on hold for a while, I could be of use to
    you, and you could be of use to me.  '
  - 'I know, not being the ruler anymore has its downsides, I don''t have to be your
    subordinate like before. Though maybe I never truly was... '
  - 'Now you''re going to get used to actually complying with other people''s wishes.
    If you wish to know more about what happened, you must bring me some souls. '
  - 'Yes, souls, you heard that right. The souls of living beings from those caves
    to the east. Sounds hard? Don''t worry though, your new undead form brings them
    out of the monsters you''ll be killing. Just get near them and they''ll be absorbed
    into your crown. '
  - 'Your first task is to acquire only one soul, to prove you still know how to use
    that "fabled" old blade of yours. Bring it to me and I''ll take care of extracting
    it from your crown and keeping it for myself. '
  - Your reward will be priceless. I shall give you more information about the truth
    behind your transformation. The more souls you get, the more stories you get to
    hear. Good deal, huh?
  - Now get to work, "your majesty".
