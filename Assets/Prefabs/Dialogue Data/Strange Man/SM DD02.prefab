  phrases:
  - '*The Strange Man absorbs the soul from your crown on sight*'
  - Nice. See, that wasn't so hard now was it?
  - Well, you're still not ruling the kingdom, so it must have been hard enough to
    get you killed.
  - What a pity! Hahaha, you'll get used to dying. After all, so many people have
    died by your armys hands, you must have been wondering what it's like. Everyone
    does that, even kings.
  - Thanks for the soul, now for your reward.
  - 'You have been cursed, king. I can''t tell you by whom just yet, but with the
    power of these souls, we might both find out at the same time. That is, if you
    continue bringing them to me. '
  - 'The curse placed upon you has changed the way time flows in the kingdom. Every
    change revolves around you. That means that if you don''t do anything, everything
    stays the same. Not even I am immune to this, I''m just more aware of it.  '
  - 'I am not your enemy, not as far as you need to know. These souls that you''ll
    be bringing me are what allows me to overpower the frozen timeline for just enough
    time to recall things I have seen before you had been cursed. '
  - Why I have seen those things is a puzzle for you to solve another day.
  - That's it, enough blabbering. Bring me two souls so that you can enjoy our next
    chat. Hahahaha.
  - '*His attitude annoys you, but you figure you need his cooperation in order to
    find out what hapened to you"'
