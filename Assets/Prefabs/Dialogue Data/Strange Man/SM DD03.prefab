  - A fine job once again. You're now mathematically twice as successful as the last
    time we spoke.
  - We both know you failed in saving the kingdom again, however.
  - Don't look at me that way with that vacant skull of yours. Tsk, it's no different
    from before. Yes, the kingdom needs saving, you think that cave filled with monsters
    was always there?
  - 'Doesn''t the very notion of it baffle you? A cave leading to your mighty household
    that you did not know about?  '
  - You always thought yourself to be more knowledgeable than you actually were, but
    a cave leading into the castle? There is no way you wouldn't have known about
    it if it existed.
  - And that's exactly my point. It didn't. It's part of your curse. The wizard who
    put you under it must have a pretty wicked sense of humor, forcing you to deal
    with hordes of monsters in order to reach your throne.
  - 'He''s probably waiting there for you as well, to laugh in your face or something.
    Hahaha. '
  - You would deserve that.
  - But keep bringing me souls and you might deserve some real praise as well, unlike
    the false one you're used to, "your majesty".
  - 'Next time I''ll need three souls. '
  - I'm looking forward to next step in our... cooperation. Hahahaha.
